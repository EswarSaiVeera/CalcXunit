**Developers perform testing to catch issues early, ensure code quality, and speed up development—even when dedicated testing teams exist.**

Here’s why developer testing remains essential alongside QA teams:

---

### 🧪 **1. Catching Bugs Early**
- **Unit testing and integration testing** by developers help identify issues at the code level before they reach QA.
- Fixing bugs early is cheaper and faster than discovering them later in the pipeline.

### ⚙️ **2. Ensuring Code Quality**
- Developers understand the logic and structure of their code best.
- Writing tests helps them validate that their code behaves as expected and adheres to design requirements.

### 🚀 **3. Faster Development Cycles**
- Developer testing reduces the back-and-forth between dev and QA teams.
- It allows for **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)**, where automated tests ensure stability before pushing changes.

### 🔄 **4. Supporting Agile and DevOps Practices**
- Agile and DevOps emphasize **shared responsibility for quality**.
- Developers test to maintain velocity and avoid bottlenecks in QA.

### 🧠 **5. Better Collaboration with QA**
- When developers test their own code, QA can focus on **exploratory, usability, and edge-case testing**.
- This division of labor improves overall coverage and product reliability.

### 🛡️ **6. Preventing Regression**
- Automated tests written by developers help ensure that new changes don’t break existing functionality.
- This is crucial for maintaining long-term stability in large codebases.

In short, developer testing isn’t about replacing QA—it’s about **building a safety net** that allows teams to move faster, collaborate better, and deliver higher-quality software. Want help writing unit tests or setting up a test framework? I can walk you through it.
